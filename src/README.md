# 🌮 Taco-Licious Ordering System

## Description of the Project

Taco-Licious is a Java console-based food ordering application that allows users to create custom tacos, order signature tacos, select drinks, add chips & salsa, and receive a complete printed receipt.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism while simulating a real-world restaurant ordering experience.

This application is intended for students, instructors, and anyone learning Java OOP principles.

## User Stories

- As a **customer**, I want to build my own taco so that I can customize everything I want to eat.
- As a **customer**, I want to choose signature tacos so that I can order quickly without entering each topping.
- As a **customer**, I want to add drinks and sides so that I can complete my meal.
- As a **customer**, I want to see a final receipt so that I know my total cost.
- As a **user**, I want the menu to guide me step-by-step so that I always know what to do next.
- As a **user**, I want the program to save my receipt so that I can review my order later.

## Setup

Instructions to set up and run the Taco-Licious application in IntelliJ IDEA.

### Prerequisites

- **IntelliJ IDEA**  
  Download: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
- **Java SDK 17 or higher**  
  Required because the app uses modern Java features such as text blocks (`"""`) and switch arrows (`->`).

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Click **Open** and choose the project folder.
3. Wait for IntelliJ to index all files.
4. Verify your SDK:
    - File → Project Structure → Project → SDK = **17**
    - File → Project Structure → Modules → Language Level = **17**
5. In the Project window, open:
6. Right-click **Main.java → Run 'Main.main()'**
7. Use the menu in the console to create your order.

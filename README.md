🌮 Taco-Licious Ordering System

## Description of the Project

Taco-Licious is a Java console-based food ordering application that 
allows users to create custom tacos, order signature tacos, select drinks, 
Add chips & salsa, and receive a complete printed receipt.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, 
abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism while simulating 
a real-world restaurant ordering experience.

## User Stories

- As a **customer**, I want to build my own taco so that I can customize everything I want to eat.
- As a **customer**, I want to choose signature tacos so that I can order quickly without entering each topping.
- As a **customer**, I want to add drinks and sides so that I can complete my meal.
- As a **customer**, I want to see a final receipt so that I know my total cost.
- As a **user**, I want the menu to guide me step-by-step so that I always know what to do next.
- As a **user**, I want the program to save my receipt so that I can review my order later.
